# BUILD_GUIDE.md — Build this project from scratch (and learn it)

This is the complete guide. If you start with an **empty folder** and follow it top to
bottom, you will end with the finished project **and** understand every piece.

It assumes you know **basic Python syntax** (variables, `if`, simple `def`, `print`). It
does **not** assume you know the "trickier" parts (`in` / `not in`, list comprehensions,
`with`, `try/except`, decorators, type hints…). Whenever one of those shows up, there is a
short **🐍 Python note** explaining it right there. There's also a full idiom cheat-sheet
in Chapter 15 you can flip back to.

> Mental anchor for the whole project: **a model answers "what is on the drawing and
> where" (boxes); plain rules answer "is the text/format right" (regex).** Two questions,
> two tools. Keep that in your head and nothing here is confusing.

## 0. How to read this

Read in order. Type the code yourself (don't copy-paste) — typing is how it sticks. After
each chapter you'll have a working piece you can run. Nothing here needs a GPU except the
model training (Chapter 13), which runs free on Google Colab.

---

## 1. What we're building

A tool where you **upload an engineering drawing image** and it **auto-fills a quality
checklist**: is the title block present, is the drawing number formatted correctly, are
the surface-roughness symbols there, the GD&T symbols, the dimensions, etc. Output = a
table of PASS / FAIL / NA + the drawing with colored boxes around what it found.

Why: today this QC is done by hand — slow, boring, easy to slip. We automate it.

We can't use the company's private drawings to train, so we **train on free public
drawing datasets** and build the checklist around what we can actually detect. Everything
company-specific lives in one config file, so the real checklist can be swapped in later
without touching code.

---

## 2. Chapter 1 — Set up the workshop

You need four things before any project code: **Python, a virtual environment, pip, and
git.**

### Python
The language everything is written in. Install **Python 3.11 or 3.12** (newer 3.14 can
break some ML libraries — they lag behind). Check:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Virtual environment (venv) — why
Each project needs specific versions of libraries. If you install everything globally,
projects clash. A **virtual environment** is a private box of libraries for *this* project
only. Create and "activate" it:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
python3.11 -m venv .venv          # creates a .venv/ folder = the box
source .venv/bin/activate         # step into the box (prompt shows (.venv))
```

`-m venv` means "run Python's built-in `venv` tool." After activating, `python` and `pip`
point inside the box.

### pip — installing libraries
`pip` downloads libraries from the internet. We list ours in a file called
`requirements.txt` so anyone can install all at once:

```
ultralytics>=8.3.0
streamlit>=1.30
pillow>=10.0
pyyaml>=6.0
pytesseract>=0.3.10
roboflow>=1.1.0
```

Install them all:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`-r` means "read this requirements file." `>=8.3.0` means "version 8.3.0 or newer."

### git — saving snapshots
`git` records snapshots ("commits") of your code so you can go back if you break
something, and push to GitHub.

```bash
git init                          # start tracking this folder
git add -A                        # stage all changes
git commit -m "first commit"      # save a snapshot with a message
```

### A note on Python files & importing
Code lives in `.py` files. A folder of `.py` files we treat as a package by putting an
empty `__init__.py` in it (we'll make a `src/` package). To use code from another file:

```python
from src.detect import detect      # import the function `detect` from src/detect.py
import yaml                         # import a whole library
```

> 🐍 **Python note — `import`:** `import yaml` loads the library so you can write
> `yaml.something()`. `from x import y` pulls one specific thing `y` out of module `x` so
> you can call `y()` directly. `src.detect` means "the file `detect.py` inside folder
> `src`."

**Project folders we'll create:**
```
config.yaml          # settings + the checklist
src/                 # the code package (with __init__.py)
scripts/             # helper command-line scripts
models/              # the trained model file goes here
data/                # datasets / demo images
notebooks/           # the Colab training notebook
```

---

## 3. Chapter 2 — Understand the data

Before gathering anything, understand what an object-detection dataset *is*.

### Images + labels
A dataset = **images** plus, for each image, a **label file** listing the objects in it.
An object = a class (what it is) + a box (where it is).

### The YOLO label format
For an image `drawing_001.jpg` there's a text file `drawing_001.txt`. One line per object:

```
class_id  x_center  y_center  width  height
```

- `class_id` is a number (0,1,2…) standing for a class name.
- the other four are the box, **normalized to 0–1** (a fraction of image width/height),
  so they stay correct even if you resize the image.

Example:
```
0 0.81 0.92 0.30 0.12     # class 0 (title_block), center at 81%,92%, size 30%×12%
2 0.45 0.40 0.08 0.03     # class 2 (dimension)
```

You won't write these by hand — the data tool (Roboflow) generates them. But judges ask
"how is a drawing labeled?" — this is the answer.

### Our classes
We use **6 classes**:
```
0 title_block
1 revision_table
2 dimension
3 note
4 gdt_symbol
5 surface_roughness
```
There are 43 different GD&T symbol types, but public data has too few of each to learn
them separately, so we **collapse all 43 into one `gdt_symbol`**. The checklist only needs
"are GD&T symbols present," not which kind.

### Train / validation / test split
You must never test a model on images it learned from — it would just recite memorized
answers. So split the data into three **disjoint** piles:

| Pile | Share | Purpose | Model learns from it? |
|---|---|---|---|
| train | 70% | the model learns (weights updated) | yes |
| validation | 20% | checked each round to catch overfitting & pick best | no, only scored |
| test | 10% | sealed; the final honest score | no |

"Disjoint" = an image is in exactly one pile. If the same drawing were in train *and*
test, your score would be a fake high (called **data leakage**).

### Size & format
- Images: `.jpg`/`.png`, resized to **960×960**.
- Labels: `.txt`, the format above.
- A `data.yaml` file lists the class names + folder paths so the trainer knows everything.
- The trained model is one file, `best.pt` (~5–20 MB).

Folder layout after export:
```
dataset/
  data.yaml
  train/ images/  labels/
  valid/ images/  labels/
  test/  images/  labels/
```

---

## 4. Chapter 3 — Gather the data (Roboflow)

We don't have labeled drawings, and labeling thousands by hand is too slow. So we reuse
**free public datasets** from **Roboflow Universe** and merge them into one.

**Roboflow** is a free website for preparing detection datasets: it hosts datasets, lets
you merge several, rename their labels to a common set, auto-create variations
(augmentation), split train/val/test, and export in YOLO format — all without code.

Steps:

1. Make a free account at roboflow.com → **Create Project** → type **Object Detection** →
   name it `drawing-checklist`. Note your **API key** (Settings → Roboflow API).
2. On Roboflow Universe, open each source dataset and **Clone** it into your project:
   - `eng-drawing` → gives `dimension`, `note`
   - `Eng_Drawing v7` → `title_block`, `revision_table`
   - `vanigaa engineering-drawing-datasets` → full-sheet objects
   - `roughness-3d` → `surface_roughness`
   - `gdt-symbols` (43 classes) → all map to `gdt_symbol`
3. **Remap labels:** in the project's Classes tool, rename every source label to one of
   our 6, and delete junk (borders, arrows). This is how 5 datasets become **one** clean
   label set → **one** model.
4. **Generate a version:** resize to 960×960; split 70/20/10; add gentle augmentation to
   the **train** pile only — rotate ±5°, brightness ±15%, slight blur. **No flips** (a
   mirrored "7" or symbol would be wrong).
5. **Export → YOLOv11** → copy the Python download snippet (you'll paste it into Colab).

That snippet looks like:
```python
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
dataset = rf.workspace("your-ws").project("drawing-checklist").version(1).download("yolov11")
```

Open the produced `data.yaml`; its `names:` order must match our class list (and our
`config.yaml`). If not, fix one to match the other.

> **Bonus dataset:** an academic set of 1,367 drawings (arXiv 2506.17374) has 9 categories
> in one clean source — perfect, but it's email-the-authors only (no public link). The
> request email is in `docs/email_1367_dataset.md`. Don't wait on it; the Roboflow merge
> is the real base.

## 5. Chapter 4 — The libraries & tools we add (and why)

| Tool / library | What it is | Why we use it |
|---|---|---|
| **Ultralytics (YOLO11)** | object-detection library | trains + runs our model in one line each |
| **Roboflow** | dataset prep website + small library | build the unified dataset, no code |
| **Google Colab** | free cloud notebook with a GPU | training needs a GPU we may not have |
| **Tesseract** + **pytesseract** | OCR engine + its Python wrapper | turn the title-block image into text |
| **Pillow (PIL)** | image library | open, crop, draw boxes |
| **PyYAML** | reads `.yaml` files | load `config.yaml` into Python |
| **`re`** (built-in) | regular expressions | check text formats (drawing-no, date) |
| **Streamlit** | turns a Python script into a web app | the upload-and-see demo UI |

We add each only when we need it. Next chapters build the code that uses them.

---

## 6. Chapter 5 — First code: the config file + loading it

We keep all settings **out of the code**, in `config.yaml`. That way you change behavior
(thresholds, rules, even the checklist) by editing one text file, never the Python.

### What YAML looks like
YAML is an indentation-based settings format. `key: value`; lists use `-`; nesting uses
indentation.

`config.yaml` (start small — we'll grow it):
```yaml
model_path: models/best.pt        # where the trained model will live
conf_threshold: 0.25              # ignore detections less confident than this

classes:                          # a LIST (each line starts with -)
  - title_block
  - revision_table
  - dimension
  - note
  - gdt_symbol
  - surface_roughness
```

### Load it in Python
Make `src/__init__.py` (empty — it just marks `src/` as a package), then start a loader.
We'll grow this file into `src/pipeline.py` later; for now just prove we can read config:

```python
import yaml

def load_config(path="config.yaml"):
    with open(path, "r") as f:        # open the file for reading
        return yaml.safe_load(f)      # parse YAML text into a Python dict

config = load_config()
print(config["conf_threshold"])       # -> 0.25
print(config["classes"])              # -> ['title_block', 'revision_table', ...]
```

> 🐍 **Python note — `with open(...) as f:`** This is a *context manager*. It opens the
> file, gives it the name `f`, and — crucially — **closes it automatically** when the
> indented block ends, even if an error happens. Without `with`, you'd have to remember
> `f.close()`. The `"r"` means "read mode."

> 🐍 **Python note — default argument `path="config.yaml"`** The `=` in a function
> definition gives a parameter a default. Call `load_config()` and it uses
> `"config.yaml"`; call `load_config("other.yaml")` to override.

> 🐍 **Python note — dict access `config["conf_threshold"]`** `yaml.safe_load` returns a
> **dictionary** (key → value). `config["key"]` fetches the value for that key. A YAML
> list becomes a Python **list** (`[...]`).

Run it: `python -c "from src.pipeline import load_config; print(load_config())"` (once the
file is `src/pipeline.py`).

---

## 7. Chapter 6 — Detection module (`src/detect.py`)

This is where the **model** runs. Goal: take an image path, return a simple list of what
was found. We hide the ML library behind a plain function so the rest of the project never
depends on it.

```python
from functools import lru_cache
import os

@lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def _load_model(model_path):
    if not os.path.exists(model_path):       # no trained model yet?
        return None
    from ultralytics import YOLO
    return YOLO(model_path)                   # load the model file

def detect(image_path, model_path, conf=0.25):
    model = _load_model(model_path)
    if model is None:
        return [], "No model — train first."  # app still works, shows NA

    results = model.predict(image_path, conf=conf, verbose=False)
    names = model.names                        # {0: 'title_block', 1: 'revision_table', ...}
    dets = []                                  # an empty list we'll fill
    for r in results:
        for box in r.boxes:                    # loop over every detected box
            dets.append({
                "cls":  names[int(box.cls[0])],
                "conf": float(box.conf[0]),
                "xyxy": [float(v) for v in box.xyxy[0].tolist()],
            })
    return dets, f"{len(dets)} detections."
```

What it returns — a **list of dictionaries**, e.g.:
```python
[{"cls": "title_block", "conf": 0.91, "xyxy": [610, 740, 940, 860]}]
```

Now the syntax used here:

> 🐍 **`@lru_cache(maxsize=1)`** A *decorator* — it wraps the function so its result is
> remembered ("cached"). The model file is big; we only want to load it once. With this,
> the first call loads it, later calls reuse the loaded model instantly.

> 🐍 **`if not os.path.exists(model_path):`** `os.path.exists(p)` returns `True`/`False`.
> `not` flips it. So this reads "if the file does NOT exist." `not` is how you negate a
> condition.

> 🐍 **`return None`** `None` is Python's "nothing" value. Returning it signals "no model."
> Later we check `if model is None:`. Use `is`/`is not` (not `==`) when comparing to `None`.

> 🐍 **`return [], "..."`** A function can return **two values at once**, separated by a
> comma — Python packs them into a *tuple*. The caller unpacks them:
> `dets, status = detect(...)`.

> 🐍 **`for r in results:` / `for box in r.boxes:`** A `for ... in ...:` loop runs the
> indented block once per item in a collection. `in` here means "iterate over." Nested
> loops = a loop inside a loop.

> 🐍 **`dets = []` then `dets.append(...)`** `[]` is an empty list. `.append(x)` adds `x`
> to the end. This is the standard "build a list as you go" pattern.

> 🐍 **`[float(v) for v in box.xyxy[0].tolist()]`** A *list comprehension* — a compact way
> to build a list. Read it right-to-left: "for each `v` in the box coordinates, compute
> `float(v)`, collect into a list." Equivalent long form:
> ```python
> tmp = []
> for v in box.xyxy[0].tolist():
>     tmp.append(float(v))
> ```
> `int(...)` / `float(...)` convert a value to a whole number / decimal.

> 🐍 **`f"{len(dets)} detections."`** An *f-string*. Putting `f` before the quotes lets you
> drop variables inside `{ }`. `len(dets)` is the length (item count) of the list.

We also add two tiny helpers used later:

```python
def count_by_class(detections):
    counts = {}
    for d in detections:
        counts[d["cls"]] = counts.get(d["cls"], 0) + 1   # tally per class
    return counts

def first_box(detections, cls_name):
    boxes = [d for d in detections if d["cls"] == cls_name]   # keep only this class
    if not boxes:
        return None
    best = max(boxes, key=lambda d: d["conf"])    # the most confident one
    return best["xyxy"]
```

> 🐍 **`counts.get(key, 0)`** `dict.get(key, default)` returns the value if the key exists,
> otherwise `default`. Safer than `counts[key]`, which would error on a missing key. Here
> it lets us start a tally at 0.

> 🐍 **`[d for d in detections if d["cls"] == cls_name]`** A list comprehension *with a
> filter* — only keeps items where the `if` is true. `==` tests equality.

> 🐍 **`if not boxes:`** An empty list is "falsy," so `not boxes` is `True` when the list is
> empty. Pythonic way to say "if there are none."

> 🐍 **`max(boxes, key=lambda d: d["conf"])`** `max` picks the biggest item. `key=` tells it
> *what* to compare by. `lambda d: d["conf"]` is a tiny one-line function meaning "given d,
> use its confidence." So this returns the highest-confidence box.

---

## 8. Chapter 7 — OCR module (`src/ocr.py`)

The model tells us *where* the title block is; OCR reads *what it says*. We crop to just
that box first — far cleaner than reading the whole busy drawing.

```python
from PIL import Image

def ocr_region(image_path, box=None):
    try:
        import pytesseract
    except ImportError:
        return "", "pytesseract not installed"

    img = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
    if box is not None:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = [int(v) for v in box]   # unpack the 4 corners
        img = img.crop((x1, y1, x2, y2))          # keep only that rectangle
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
    return text, "ok"
```

> 🐍 **`try: ... except ImportError:`** A *try/except* runs the risky code; if a specific
> error happens, it jumps to `except` instead of crashing. `ImportError` happens when a
> library isn't installed. So: "try to use OCR; if it's missing, return empty text and a
> message" — the app keeps running.

> 🐍 **`if box is not None:`** Only crop if a box was given. `is not None` = "has a real
> value." `box=None` in the signature makes the argument optional (defaults to nothing).

> 🐍 **`x1, y1, x2, y2 = [...]`** *Unpacking* — assign four list items to four variables in
> one line. The right side must have exactly four items.

---

## 9. Chapter 8 — Rules module (`src/rules.py`)

This is the **non-ML half**: checking text formats with **regular expressions (regex)**. A
regex is a pattern string. The built-in `re` library matches it against text.

```python
import re

def check_rule(rule_cfg, text):
    pattern = rule_cfg.get("pattern", "")
    if not pattern or not text:
        return False, None
    m = re.search(pattern, text)
    return (bool(m), m.group(0) if m else None)
```

Example pattern `\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{2}` means "two digits, slash, two digits, slash, two
digits" → matches a `DD/MM/YY` date. If `re.search` finds it anywhere in the text, the
check passes.

> 🐍 **`if not pattern or not text:`** `or` is true if *either* side is true. `not pattern`
> is true when the pattern string is empty; same for text. So: "if we have no pattern OR no
> text, give up." Combining `not` + `or` to guard against missing inputs is very common.

> 🐍 **`bool(m)`** `re.search` returns a *match object* if found, or `None` if not. `bool(x)`
> turns anything into `True`/`False` — a match object is truthy, `None` is falsy. So
> `bool(m)` is "did it match?"

> 🐍 **`m.group(0) if m else None`** A *ternary expression*: `VALUE_IF_TRUE if CONDITION
> else VALUE_IF_FALSE`. Reads "the matched text if there was a match, otherwise None."
> `m.group(0)` is the exact piece of text that matched.

Add the rules to `config.yaml`:
```yaml
rules:
  drawing_number:
    description: "Drawing number present & format valid"
    pattern: '[A-Z]{2,3}[-\s]?\d?[-\s]?[A-Z]{2,4}[-\s]?\d{3,4}'
  date:
    pattern: '\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{2}'
```
Change a pattern → change the rule. No code edit. (For the real company format
`TR X XXX XXXX`, the pattern becomes `^TR\s?\d\s?[A-Z]{3}\s?\d{4}$`.)

---

## 10. Chapter 9 — Report module (`src/report.py`)

The heart of the "checklist." It reads the `checklist:` section of `config.yaml` and turns
detections + OCR text into PASS / FAIL / NA rows.

First, the checklist in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
checklist:
  - id: 1
    point: "Title block present"
    type: presence            # PASS if class detected ≥1, else FAIL
    requires_class: title_block
  - id: 2
    point: "Drawing number present & format valid"
    type: rule                # PASS/FAIL from regex on title-block text
    requires_rule: drawing_number
  - id: 4
    point: "Surface-roughness symbols present"
    type: count               # PASS if ≥1, remark = how many
    requires_class: surface_roughness
  - id: 6
    point: "Dimensions detected"
    type: count_info          # never fails, just reports the count
    requires_class: dimension
```

The engine:
```python
from .detect import count_by_class
from .rules import check_rule

def build_report(config, detections, ocr_text, model_loaded):
    counts = count_by_class(detections)
    rules_cfg = config.get("rules", {})
    rows = []

    for item in config["checklist"]:
        itype = item["type"]
        status, remarks = "NA", ""

        if itype in ("presence", "presence_optional", "count", "count_info"):
            n = counts.get(item["requires_class"], 0)
            if not model_loaded:
                status, remarks = "NA", "model not loaded"
            elif itype == "presence":
                status = "PASS" if n >= 1 else "FAIL"
                remarks = f"{n} found"
            elif itype == "count":
                status = "PASS" if n >= 1 else "FAIL"
                remarks = f"{n} found"
            elif itype == "count_info":
                status, remarks = "INFO", f"{n} found"
            elif itype == "presence_optional":
                status = "PASS" if n >= 1 else "NA"
                remarks = f"{n} found" if n else "none (optional)"

        elif itype == "rule":
            if not ocr_text:
                status, remarks = "NA", "no title-block text"
            else:
                matched, found = check_rule(rules_cfg[item["requires_rule"]], ocr_text)
                status = "PASS" if matched else "FAIL"
                remarks = f"matched: {found}" if matched else "pattern not found"

        rows.append({"id": item["id"], "point": item["point"],
                     "status": status, "remarks": remarks})
    return rows
```

> 🐍 **`from .detect import count_by_class`** The leading dot means "from this same package
> (`src/`)." So it imports from `src/detect.py`. This is a *relative import*.

> 🐍 **`if itype in ("presence", "count", ...):`** **THE `in` keyword.** `x in collection`
> is `True` if `x` is one of the items. Here `(...)` is a *tuple* of allowed types, so this
> reads "if itype is any of these four." The opposite, `not in`, is `True` when `x` is
> absent: `if cls not in counts:`.

> 🐍 **`if / elif / else` chain** Python checks each condition top to bottom; the first true
> one runs, the rest are skipped. `elif` = "else if." Use it to pick one outcome among
> many.

> 🐍 **`status = "PASS" if n >= 1 else "FAIL"`** Ternary again — assign one of two values

> 🐍 **`status, remarks = "NA", "model not loaded"`** Assign two variables at once. Right
> side is a tuple; it's unpacked into the two names.

Status meanings: **PASS** good, **FAIL** problem, **NA** can't check / not applicable,
**INFO** just a count.

## 11. Chapter 10 — Annotate module (`src/annotate.py`)

Draw the detected boxes on the image so the demo is visual.

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

_PALETTE = [(230,25,75), (60,180,75), (0,130,200), (245,130,48),
            (145,30,180), (70,240,240), (240,50,230), (210,245,60)]

def _color(cls_name):
    return _PALETTE[hash(cls_name) % len(_PALETTE)]   # stable color per class

def annotate(image_path, detections):
    img = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    for d in detections:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = d["xyxy"]
        c = _color(d["cls"])
        draw.rectangle([x1, y1, x2, y2], outline=c, width=3)
        draw.text((x1 + 2, max(0, y1 - 12)), f"{d['cls']} {d['conf']:.2f}", fill=c)
    return img
```

> 🐍 **`hash(cls_name) % len(_PALETTE)`** `hash()` turns the class name into a big number;
> `%` (modulo) gives the remainder when divided by the palette length, so the result is
> always a valid index 0–7. Same name → same color every time. `_PALETTE[index]` picks the
> color at that position (lists are indexed from 0).

> 🐍 **`f"{d['conf']:.2f}"`** Inside an f-string, `:.2f` formats a number to 2 decimal
> places (0.9134 → `0.91`). Note single quotes inside the `{ }` because the f-string uses
> double quotes.

> 🐍 **Leading underscore `_color`, `_PALETTE`** A naming convention meaning "internal /
> private — not meant to be used outside this file." Python doesn't enforce it; it's a hint
> to humans.

## 12. Chapter 11 — Pipeline (`src/pipeline.py`)

This ties all modules together into one function the UI calls.

```python
import os
import yaml
from .detect import detect, first_box
from .ocr import ocr_region
from .report import build_report
from .annotate import annotate

_CONFIG_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "config.yaml")

def load_config(path=_CONFIG_PATH):
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)

def run(image_path, config=None):
    if config is None:
        config = load_config()

    detections, det_status = detect(image_path, config["model_path"], config["conf_threshold"])
    model_loaded = "No model" not in det_status and "not installed" not in det_status

    tb_box = first_box(detections, "title_block")
    ocr_text, ocr_status = ocr_region(image_path, tb_box) if tb_box else ("", "no title_block")

    rows = build_report(config, detections, ocr_text, model_loaded)
    annotated = annotate(image_path, detections)

    debug = {"detection_status": det_status, "ocr_status": ocr_status,
             "ocr_text": ocr_text.strip(), "n_detections": len(detections)}
    return annotated, rows, debug
```

> 🐍 **`os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "config.yaml")`** `__file__` is the
> path of the current file. `os.path.dirname(...)` strips to its folder. `".."` means "up
> one folder." `os.path.join` glues path pieces with the right separator for your OS. Net
> result: the path to `config.yaml` regardless of where you run the script from.

> 🐍 **`"No model" not in det_status`** `not in` on a **string** checks whether one string
> is *absent* inside another. So this is `True` when the status text doesn't contain "No
> model" — i.e. a model really loaded.

> 🐍 **`ocr_region(...) if tb_box else ("", "no title_block")`** Ternary controlling a call:
> only run OCR if we found a title block; otherwise use empty text. `if tb_box` is truthy
> when `tb_box` isn't `None`.

> 🐍 **`config=None` then `if config is None:`** A common pattern for "optional argument
> with a computed default." You can't write `config=load_config()` in the signature
> (it would run at import time), so you default to `None` and fill it inside.

## 13. Chapter 12 — The app (`app.py`, Streamlit)

Streamlit turns this script into a web page. Each `st.` call draws a widget. Streamlit
re-runs the whole script whenever the user interacts — so a slider change instantly
re-runs detection.

```python
import tempfile, csv, io
import streamlit as st
from src.pipeline import run, load_config

st.title("Engineering Drawing — Automated Checklist")
config = load_config()

conf = st.slider("Detection confidence", 0.05, 0.90, 0.25, 0.05)
config["conf_threshold"] = conf

uploaded = st.file_uploader("Upload a drawing sheet", type=["png", "jpg", "jpeg"])
if uploaded:
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".png") as tmp:
        tmp.write(uploaded.read())
        tmp_path = tmp.name

    annotated, rows, debug = run(tmp_path, config)

    passed = sum(1 for r in rows if r["status"] == "PASS")
    failed = sum(1 for r in rows if r["status"] == "FAIL")
    st.metric("Checks passed", f"{passed}/{passed + failed}")
    st.image(annotated)
    st.table(rows)
```

Run with `streamlit run app.py` → opens in your browser.

> 🐍 **`sum(1 for r in rows if r["status"] == "PASS")`** A *generator expression* inside
> `sum`. It yields `1` for each row whose status is PASS; `sum` adds them → the count of
> PASS rows. Same idea as a list comprehension but without building a list. Classic
> "count items matching a condition" one-liner.

> 🐍 **`with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(...) as tmp:`** Streamlit gives the upload as
> in-memory bytes; YOLO wants a file path. We write the bytes to a temporary file (again
> using `with`, which cleans up handles) and pass its path on.

## 14. Chapter 13 — The model: YOLO11 + training

### Why YOLO
We need to find **multiple objects** and **where** they are — that's *object detection*,
not classification (one label per image). **YOLO11** (the Ultralytics library) is the
easiest detector to train, runs fast in a single pass, and ships **pretrained weights** so
a small dataset is enough.

### Architecture (what's inside)
```
image → BACKBONE (Conv + C3k2 blocks + SPPF + C2PSA attention) → features at 3 sizes
      → NECK (PAN-FPN: mixes fine detail with big-picture context)
      → HEAD (anchor-free: each grid cell predicts class + box via DFL)
      → decode → drop low confidence → NMS → final boxes
```
- **Convolutions** are filters that slide over the image detecting patterns (edges →
  shapes → "looks like a title block"). Stacked, they form the **backbone**.
- **3 feature sizes (P3/P4/P5)** let it catch tiny symbols *and* big blocks.
- **anchor-free head** = each cell predicts a box directly (no preset templates).
- **NMS** (Non-Max Suppression) removes duplicate overlapping boxes for the same object.

### How training works
1. **Forward pass:** push images through → predicted boxes.
2. **Loss:** measure error vs the true labels (class error + box error + DFL).
3. **Backpropagation:** compute how each weight affected the error.
4. **Optimizer step:** nudge weights to reduce error, by the *learning rate*.
5. One full pass over the train set = one **epoch**; do ~80.
6. **Transfer learning:** we start from `yolo11n.pt` (already trained on a huge generic
   dataset), so it knows edges/shapes already — we only *fine-tune* it on drawings. That's
   why a few hundred images suffice.

### Train it on Colab (free GPU)
`notebooks/train_yolo.ipynb` runs this:
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")              # pretrained nano model
model.train(data="data.yaml", epochs=80, imgsz=960, batch=16)
model.val()                             # prints mAP, saves metric plots
```
- `epochs` — how many passes (too few = dumb model; too many = memorizes).
- `imgsz` — input resolution (match the 960 you exported).
- `batch` — images per step (lower it if the GPU runs out of memory).

Download the resulting `best.pt` → put it in `models/best.pt` → the app comes alive.

### Reading the score
- **Precision** — of predicted boxes, how many were right (low = false alarms).
- **Recall** — of real objects, how many it found (low = misses).
- **mAP50** — the headline accuracy (higher better; ~0.5+ is a fine demo).
- **Confusion matrix** — which classes get mixed up.
Ultralytics saves these as images — screenshot them for the pitch (proof of real ML).

## 15. Chapter 14 — Run, test, debug

```bash
python scripts/check_setup.py          # doctor: lists what's installed / missing
python scripts/try_pretrained.py       # watch a generic YOLO detect (learning)
python scripts/run_cli.py drawing.png  # run our full pipeline in the terminal
./scripts/serve.sh                     # launch the web app
```

The CLI runner (`scripts/run_cli.py`) prints the checklist as a table and saves an
annotated image — handy for an offline backup demo (never trust venue wifi).

> 🐍 **`if __name__ == "__main__":`** At the bottom of scripts you'll see this. When you run
> a file directly, Python sets `__name__` to `"__main__"`, so the block runs. When the file
> is *imported* by another, `__name__` is the module name, so the block is skipped. It's how
> a file can be both a runnable script and an importable library.

> 🐍 **`sys.argv`** A list of the command-line words. `sys.argv[0]` is the script name;
> `sys.argv[1]` is the first argument you typed. That's how `run_cli.py drawing.png` knows
> which image to use.

## 16. Chapter 15 — Python idiom cheat-sheet

Everything "complex" used in this project, in one place:

| `not` | flip a condition | `if not boxes:` (list is empty) |
| `and` / `or` | combine conditions | `if a and b:` / `if a or b:` |
| `is None` / `is not None` | compare to "nothing" | `if box is not None:` |

| f-string `f"{x}"` | embed values in text | `f"{n} found"` |
| `:.2f` in f-string | format a number | `f"{conf:.2f}"` |
| `@lru_cache` | remember a function's result | load model once |

## 18. Chapter 17 — Rebuild-from-scratch checklist

Do these in order and you've built the whole thing:

1. [ ] Install Python 3.11/3.12, make a venv, `git init`.
2. [ ] Write `requirements.txt`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `brew install tesseract`.
3. [ ] Create folders: `src/` (+ empty `__init__.py`), `scripts/`, `models/`, `data/`, `notebooks/`.
4. [ ] Build the unified dataset in Roboflow (Chapter 3); export YOLOv11; note the snippet.
5. [ ] Write `config.yaml` (classes, conf, rules, checklist).
6. [ ] Write `src/detect.py`, `ocr.py`, `rules.py`, `report.py`, `annotate.py`, `pipeline.py`.
7. [ ] Write `app.py`; run `streamlit run app.py` — works with NA rows (no model yet).
8. [ ] Train on Colab (`train_yolo.ipynb`); download `best.pt` → `models/`.
9. [ ] Re-run the app; verify boxes + checklist on a few drawings.
10. [ ] Prepare 3–4 demo drawings (PASS / FAIL / NA), screenshot metrics, rehearse the pitch.

If you can do these without re-reading, you understand the project. That's the goal.
